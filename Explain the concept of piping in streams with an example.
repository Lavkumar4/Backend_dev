How Piping Works

Data from the readable stream's data events is pushed directly into the writable stream via the .pipe() method. 
The readable stream pauses when the writable's buffer fills, resuming automatically for backpressure handling. 
Errors propagate through the chain

const fs = require('fs');

const readStream = fs.createReadStream('source.txt');
const writeStream = fs.createWriteStream('output.txt');

readStream.pipe(writeStream);

writeStream.on('finish', () => {
  console.log('File copied!');
});

Chained Piping
Add transformation (e.g., uppercase):

const { Transform } = require('stream');

const upperStream = new Transform({
  transform(chunk, encoding, callback) {
    this.push(chunk.toString().toUpperCase());
    callback();
  }
});

readStream.pipe(upperStream).pipe(writeStream);
